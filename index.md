## Why This Matters

Most engineers optimize for performance or scale. I optimize for impact in environments where failure has consequences.

**Press Freedom:** Journalists need secure tools to investigate corruption without compromising sources. I built Stringboard.

**Manufacturing Resilience:** When supply chains collapse, distributed capacity exists but lacks coordination. I'm building that infrastructure.

**Commercial Value:** Enterprises need AI systems that actually work in production. I architect and deliver them.
